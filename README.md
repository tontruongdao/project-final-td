## ABOUT THE APPLICATION

​
This web app was created as my final project submission for Concordia's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
​
The idea this application is to have an easy-to-make recipe register in order to optimize a programmer's time.

I used React.js, Express.js and Firebase for this project.
